# React Frontend

React demonstration that uses the java_backend API.  This is intended more as an illustration than an exemplar,
as there is so much variation in frontend approaches that a prescribed exemplar would probably be unduly
restrictive. It does provide facilities that may serve as a good starting point, though.

## API
Assumes the API is running at `http://localhost:8080/api`.

## Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the displayed URL.

Changes to the frontend will automatically deploy.

## Build for deployment
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Distributable site will be in the `dist` directory.
